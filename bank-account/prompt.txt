Act as an experienced AWK and Bash developer.

Below is an example of test for one of our existing exercises:
```
#!/usr/bin/env bats
load bats-extra

@test "change for 1 cent" {
    #[[ $BATS_RUN_SKIPPED == "true" ]] || skip
    run gawk -f change.awk <<END_INPUT
1 5 10 25
1
END_INPUT
    assert_success
    assert_output "1"
}

@test "error testing for change smaller than the smallest of coins" {
    [[ $BATS_RUN_SKIPPED == "true" ]] || skip
    run gawk -f change.awk <<END_INPUT
5 10
3
END_INPUT
    assert_failure
    assert_output "can't make target with given coins"
}
```

We need to create bats tests for our new exercise for the AWK track on the Exercism site.
The exercise description is

The exercise descriptions is
"""
{{description}}
"""

The sample solution is
```awk
{{solution}}
```

The test cases described in json:
```json
{{testCases}}
```

Your task is to analyse the description, sample solution and test cases and create tests for the exercise.
If you have any questions feel free to ask me before you start processing.
