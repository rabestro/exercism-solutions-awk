# AWK Solutions for Exercism

## Description

This repository contains my solutions for Exercism exercises, written in Gnu AWK. Each solution is in its own folder, which includes the AWK script for the solution, a test file in Bats, and a README with the exercise description.

Please note that these solutions are tested on Gnu AWK and may not work on older versions of AWK. Some solutions may require additional variables to be set via the `-v` key. You can check the tests for each solution to see the correct command to use.

As a contributor to the AWK track on Exercism, I'm the author of two exercises:

- [Automated readability index](https://exercism.org/tracks/awk/exercises/automated-readability-index)
- [Mazy Mice](https://exercism.org/tracks/awk/exercises/mazy-mice)

## Installation

To run these solutions locally, you'll need to install Gnu AWK and Bats.

- For Gnu AWK, you can typically find it preinstalled on Unix-like operating systems. For Windows, you can install it through [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). Make sure you're using Gnu AWK, as these solutions may not work on older versions of AWK.
- For Bats, you can find installation instructions on the [Bats GitHub page](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core#installation).

## Usage

To run a solution, navigate to its directory and run the AWK script with the `awk -f` command. For example:

```bash
awk -f solution.awk
```
